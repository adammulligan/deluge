This is a Node.JS frontend for rtorrent, using its XMLRPC API to display
torrents and file uploads to create new torrents.

## Development

This is structured around the [Node Express CoffeeScript Stack
Template](wcmc.io/87ab).

  * Install all dependencies with `npm install`
  * Run the application with `cake dev`
  * Have a look at `Cakefile` for some more run options.
